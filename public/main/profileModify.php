        What's needed:
        - img to display the user's profile picture (if it's null, then it would show the default image)
            with a button to modify the image (window to choose the new image with the entire path)
        - input text to display the username and the password
        - button for confirm the changes

        Eventually there would be also some other objects in order to make the graphic better
