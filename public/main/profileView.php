        What's needed:
        - img to display the user's profile picture (if it's null, then it would show the default image)
        - labels to display the username and the password
        - button for changing the updateble information (it redirect the user to the page where it's possible to modify the info)

        Eventually there would be also some other objects in order to make the graphic better
